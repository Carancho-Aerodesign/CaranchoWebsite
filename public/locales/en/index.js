        In this category, teams are challenged to design and build extremely light and compact aircraft models,
        with even more restrictive weight and dimension specifications than other categories.
        One of the main goals of the Micro class is to maximize payload efficiency relative to the total weight of the aircraft.
        This requires teams to achieve a high degree of engineering precision and innovation
        to optimize every aspect of the design, from material selection to aerodynamics and engine efficiency.`,

        compared to the Advanced and Micro classes. This category is designed to provide a balanced challenge,
        allowing new engineers to apply basic aeronautical engineering knowledge in a practical context,
